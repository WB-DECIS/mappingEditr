\title{Create a concept-to-codelist lookup dataframe from an SDMX DSD response}
\usage{
create_concepts_to_cl_lkup(resp)
}
\arguments{
\item{resp}{A parsed R list representing an SDMX DSD response, similar
to the format returned by `rsdmx` or equivalent SDMX APIs.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with two columns:
  \describe{
    \item{concept_id}{Extracted concept ID.}
    \item{codelist_id}{Associated codelist ID, or `NA` if none.}
  }
}
\description{
This function parses an SDMX Data Structure Definition (DSD) response,
extracting all concepts (dimensions, attributes, and measures) and
their associated codelists (if any).
}
\details{
The function assumes that the input `resp` contains a structure like:
\code{resp$DataStructure[[1]]}, which has lists of `dimensions`,
`attributes`, and `measures`, each with `concept` and optionally
`representation$representation` fields. The `concept` is a URN from which
the actual concept ID is extracted, and the `codelist` (if present)
is parsed from the `representation` URN.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `resp` is the parsed SDMX DSD response as shown in the user's example:
# result <- create_concepts_to_cl_lkup(resp)
# head(result)

}
